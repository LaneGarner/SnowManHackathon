# HangManHackathon

* First build this project in the terminal
* Then attach it to the DOM
* Work through the challenge together
* As always whiteboard it and make a code plan
* Translate from English to pseudo code then to JavaScript
* Test
* Present to class
* Turn in the URL to your repo, once for each person in your group
* Further Practice Challenge - Keep track of the user's lives, so if they guess incorrectly they lose a life.
